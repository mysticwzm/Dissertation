My dissertation in University of Edinburgh : Stream-based workflows with dispel4py library

Dispel4py is available : https://github.com/dispel4py/dispel4py, which is a "free and open-source Python library for describing abstract stream-based workflows for distributed data-intensive applications".

My task of this dissertation is to test the performance of dispel4py and compare it with other parallel computing frameworks like Hadoop, MPI.
